Connect Arduino to your Computer and make sure that the correct drivers are installed.

Open Device Manager
--> Right Click My Computer
--> Select Manage
--> Click on Device Manager

If Arduino Board is correctly installed, a SERIAL COM PORT will be visible.

Note down the COM PORT Number.

Open Atmel Studio
--> Create a NEW Project
------> Do NOT put spaces in the PROJECT NAME, use _(underscore) or -(dash)
--> Type: GCC C Executable Project
--> Select the CORRECT Microcontroller - ATMEGA328p for Arduino Uno/Nano - ATMEGA2560 or 1280 for Arduino Mega.

Click on Project, in the Menu Bar
--> Select Properties (last item) - Alt+F7
--> Click on Build Events
--> Copy the below command in the POST-BUILD EVENT COMMAND LINE BOX
C:\AoA\avrdude -p atmega328p -c arduino -P COM3 -b 57600 -D -U flash:w:$(AssemblyName).hex:i

***** IF using Arduino MEGA, replace "-c arduino" with
"-c wiring"

*   See Atmel Studio SCREENSHOT in the AoA Folder
**  Some Arduino Drivers are provided in the AoA Folder for your convenience
*** For the Above command to work, you MUST copy the Folder, "AoA" in your C Drive - otherwise edit the command as necessary.
****Figure out the COMPORT number of Arduino on your computer - change the above COM3 to the CORRECT port number.

--> Save and Close the Project properties Window

--> in the main source code file of your project, add in the first line:
#define F_CPU 16000000UL

--> Write your program as normal AVR Program using C code and when you press Build, it will try to UPLOAD the code to the Arduino Board as well.
-----> The Arduino Board, MUST be connected to the computer.

In case of any ERROR or PROBLEM, kindly email me at zaidpirwani@ejaad.com.pk

Mention your OS, how the error occured and also a snapshot of the Error.
